<h1 align="left">Greetings!</h1>

I'm a Junior Front-End Developer, focusing on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices, and writing clean JavaScript. I create websites that work well on different devices and look nice. While I'm into UI/UX design, I admit I'm not super creative. I often look for inspiration when designing to ensure things look nice and work well. Anyways, feel free to connect with me on social media. 

You can always find me at [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/iampangks/), If you're curious about my works, check out my projects on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/francismcpc), also i will be writing blogs soon to share cool stuff with you all, I'm excited to contribute and learn. You can check y blogs here at [DEV Community](https://www.instagram.com/iampangks/), that's all folks let's connect, learn, and grow together!
