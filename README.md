<h1 align="left">Greetings!</h1>

I'm a Junior Front-End Developer, I focus on writing accessible HTML, using modern CSS practices and writing clean JavaScript. I make websites that work well on different devices and look nice. I'm also into UI/UX design, but I admit I'm not super creative. I often look for inspiration when I'm designing to make sure things look nice and work well.
